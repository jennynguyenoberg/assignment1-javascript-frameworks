# Assignment 1

### 1. Recreate and improve
- ✅ Recreate the code/steps of the presentation
- ✅ ...but use content, styling and images of your own choosing
- ✅ The 1st article should be about you what you've done so far when it comes to programming and what you would - like to explore further on. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ✅ The 2nd article should be about your idea for you first personal project. The name of the idea/project and a motivation to why you choose that idea. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ✅ An additional article, the 3rd article, should be about the design style you wish to apply to your first personal project. Include a motivation as to why you picked that style. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ✅ Add buttons that switch between all three articles (like pagination).
- ❌ Make the button reflect which article is shown. (I.e. the button for a given article has another styling than the other buttons when the active article is shown.)
- ❌ BONUS: Add a button that shows all articles at the same time.
- ❌ BONUS: update the title depending on what article is shown. You can watch the video below for an example if we don't go through this during class
- ✅ Make sure you commit and push your work to a public github repo, and when you are done with all the assignments, add a link in the assignment for week 1.
