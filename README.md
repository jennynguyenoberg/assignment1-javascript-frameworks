# Assignment 1

### 1. Recreate and improve
#### Instructions:
- ‚úÖ Recreate the code/steps of the presentation
- ‚úÖ ...but use content, styling and images of your own choosing
- ‚úÖ The 1st article should be about you what you've done so far when it comes to programming and what you would like to explore further on. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ‚úÖ The 2nd article should be about your idea for you first personal project (see below). The name of the idea/project and a motivation to why you choose that idea. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ‚úÖ An additional article, the 3rd article, should be about the design style you wish to apply to your first personal project (see below for instructions). Include a motivation as to why you picked that style. A couple of sentences is enough.
- ‚ùå Add buttons that switch between all three articles (like pagination).
- ‚úÖ Make the button reflect which article is shown. (I.e. the button for a given article has another styling than the other buttons when the active article is shown.)
- BONUS: Add a button that shows all articles at the same time.
- ‚úÖ BONUS: update the title depending on what article is shown. You can watch the useState/useEffect video below for an example if we don't go through this during class.
- ‚úÖ Make sure you commit and push your work to a public github repo (or a private repo but by also inviting me as a contributor).
- ‚úÖ When you are done with all the assignments, add a link to your GitHub repo in the assignment for week 1. (You don't need to create a GitHub Pages.)
